## Final reply

The commit failed because a pre-commit hook ran the test suite and a test is failing. The test `test_rates_service_configured` requires the `TALLY_RATES_URL` environment variable to be set, which it isn't in this environment.

This is unrelated to the typo fix. What would you like me to do? I can:
1. Set the environment variable and retry the commit
2. Check if there's a way to skip or configure this test
3. Check the git hooks to understand what's required

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
